<p style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase; color: #fbe55b;">Installing Django</p>
<p>pip 'pip install packages' is used to install Django. Pip is widely accepted as the industry-standard tool for
    installing
    python packages.
</p>
<p> <u>Step 1</u> <br>
    In the terminal use 'pip3 install django' - the 3 is used so that it is installed for python version 3.<br>
    If you ever need to check what version of python you are using use 'python --version' in the terminal.
</p>

<p>
    <u>Step 2</u><br>
    After installing Django. Use the django-admin function to start a new django project. <br>
    For this example it will be called all_recipes.
</p>
<img src="../../media/step-2.png" class="Step1">
<br>
<p>
    The dot at the end will tell django we want to create a project in the current directory.
</p>
<p>
    Once the new project has been installed, two new items will appear in the file explorer.<br>
    The first one is the project name folder i.e all_recipes, which is the project directory.<br>
    The second one is manage.py - this is django management utility, which we will need throughout the project.
</p>
<img src="../../media/step-3.png" class="Step3">
<br>
<br>
<p><u>__init__.py</u> - This tells our project this is a file we can import from.</p>
<p><u>settings.py</u> - Contains global settings for entire django project. I.e. Where our HTML templates are located
    and which database we're going to connect to</p>
<p><u>urls.py</u> - Containes routing information that allows users to type a specific URL into their address bar.</p>
<p><u>wsgi.py</u> - Contains code that allows our web server to communicate with our Python application.</p>
<br>
<p><u>To run the django app:</u></p>
<p>
    After following the first two steps, your Django app will be connected. <br>
    To run the app use, <b>python3 manage.py runserver</b>. If all is working correctly the following webpage will show.
</p>

<p><u>Step 3 - initial migration</u></p>
<p>
    When you first start a new django project, you have run 'python3 manage.py migrate'.
    Migrations apply changes to the model to the database.
    To learn more about migrations, go to the migrations section.
</p>
<img src="../../media/step-5.png" class="Step1">
<hr>
<p><u>Step 4 - Create a superuser</u></p>
<p>
    In order to log in to the admin a 'superuser' needs to be created.<br>
    Run python3 manage.py createsuperuser in the terminal, it will then prompt you for a username, email and password,
    these will be your log in credentials.<br>
    Having a superuser allows backend access to CRUD functionality - which is helpful in development and testing.

<p style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase; color: #f4816f;">Setting up the base template</p>
<p>
    Django allows us to build a base template 'base.html' which all other templates can inherit from.<br>
    This contains all the information that goes into the head tag, such as link tags, script tags and meta data, meaning
    you don't have to include it on every page. <br><br>
    Django provides a templating system that allows us to create HTML files in a template directory within each app.
    Django blocks used in the base.html will be inherited by any templates that extends from it.<br>
    To extend from the base.html the top of the page must include the following:
</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase; color: #f7a74a;">Setting Up Static Files</p>
<p>
    Static files include CSS, JS and images. When using Django, you have to set you static files in a certain way. <br>
    1. Make a static folder, within that folder make a css folder with a file named base.css <br>
    2. In settings.py add the following to the bottom on the page, this tells Django where to look for static files
    that are not in a particular app.
</p>
<img src="../../media/static.png" class="step4"><br>
<p>
    3. Add the link tag to the CSS in the base.html.
</p>
<img src="../../media/staticlink.png" class="step1"><br><br>
<p>
    4. At the top of every HTML page add the following so that it loads the static pages:
</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase; color: #fbe55b;">Setting up Media files</p>
<p>To set up media files:<br>
    1. Make a media folder.<br>
    2.Add the following to the settings.py file below the static files information:
</p>
<img src="../../media/media.png" class="step4"><br>
<p>
    3. In the project level urls.py file add the following:
</p>
<img src="../../media/mediaurl.png" class="step4"><br><br>

<p>The Django project should now be set up. </p>
