<p>
 Strings are a collection of characters, numbers and symbols. Strings are how we display text and data, making it one of the most fundamental concepts in JavaScript to understand. <br>
    There are three ways of creating a string:<br>
    1. With single quotations i.e <pre>'I am a string'</pre>
    2. With double quotations i.e <pre>"I am also a string"</pre>
    3. Using template literals or backticks i.e <pre>`You guessed it, I am a string too!`</pre><br>
    It does not matter which technique you use, as long as it matched at the beginning and end, otherwise errors can occur<br>
    e.g. var string = 'The developer said 'Make sure you use the correct syntax' to the intern.' <br>
    console.log(string) => 'The developer said' <br>
    This is because JS has ended the string after the second '. To correct this put the quote in double quotations or use template literals.<br>
    Each has its advantages and disadvantages which we will go into in more depth further down.<br><br>
    Strings can be stored in variables to be called later on in the code, like the above example.

<p style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase; color: #fbe55b;">String Concatenation:</p>

        <p>This is the joining of two or more strings using the + symbol. <br>
        e.g.<br>
        <pre>
            var book = "Harry Potter"
            var author = "J K Rowling"

            var FaveBook = "My favourite book is " + book + " by" + author.

            console.log(FaveBook);
            My favourite book is Harry Potter by J K Rowling.
        </pre>
        </p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase; color: #f4816f;">Template literals:</p>
        <p>Template literals are a relatively new concept to JavaScript. It is simply constructing a string with backticks ``, instead of quotations. <br>
        The advantages of this include:<br>
        It reduces risk of error by using the incorrect quotations throughout the string.<br>
        It provides a multi line support, so \n is not needed. Which reduces the amount of code that needs to be written and makes it look cleaner. e.g.
        <pre>
        var TemplateString = `This string
                                will print out on multiple
                                lines because we used
                                a template literal`
        </pre>
        Another benefit of template literal is string interpolation. This is a way of joining strings together usng ${}. This is quicker, easier and looks cleaner than string concatenation. e.g.
        <pre>
        var book = "Harry Potter"
        var author = "J K Rowling"

        var FaveBook = `My favourite book is ${book} by ${author}`

            console.log(FaveBook);
            My favourite book is Harry Potter by J K Rowling.
        </pre>
        We have used the same example as above and as you can see it is a lot easier to read.

    <p style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase; color: #f7a74a;">Methods</p>
            Different methods can be used to find information out about a string or manipulate a string in a particular way.<br>
    NB. Javascript starts counting from 0, so in this string, "hello" h would be index 0.
